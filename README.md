# JD-BopIt
ECE 1895 - Summer 23 - Bop It Project

# Directory Structure
- separate directory for each section
- All source code is in one file: [software/BopIt-Code-1/BopIt-Code-1.ino](https://github.com/jjo527/JD-BopIt/blob/main/software/BopIt-Code-1/BopIt-Code-1.ino)
- all PCB files are in the hardware directory
- files used for laser cutting are in the enclosure directory
- the old directory stuff was used for some debugging, but is not longer important
